## Installation
Visit our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/Ahz5YERU5uIIPM5O_v_XSg) for the latest releases or download from [...].

* You might need to uninstall any previous Jodel/Patched before install

To best enjoy the spoofing feature and the account backup we recommend installing our companion app, *JodelTools*.


## Features
* Toggle beta features
* Spoof location (applied only to Jodel)
	* *JodelTools* required
* Upload from gallery
* No blur on images
* Save image by double tap
* Copy text by double tap
* Account backup
	* *JodelTools* required

Images are saved to `/sdcard/JodelPatched/images`.


### Account backup
`UDI` stands for *Unique Device Identifier*. This id is generated by the Jodel app and is used to identify your account. It is used by the built in backup to restore your account on a new device, however, this backup isn't supported by JodelPatched.

Instead you can use our companion app *JodelTools* to backup your own UDI to `/sdcard/JodelPatched/udi`.

The file is automatically utilized when JodelPatched is first launched.

*Do not share your udi file with anyone.*

## Debug features
* Inspection via Stetho with Chrome devtools (`chrome://inspect`)

## Moral code
One should not aim to disrupt Jodels foundation. Bans, analytics and regular user data collection is not intended to be circumvented.

Follow these steps to get started.

1. Place source `.apk` into `source/apk/`
