// DexPatcher APK Library plugin:

apply plugin: 'com.github.lanchon.dexpatcher.apk-library'

// The DexPatcher APK Library plugin processes an Android application (APK) file and
// produces a DexPatcher APK library file that can be used to create modified versions
// of the source application. The file is similar in structure to an Android Library
// (AAR) file. It includes the decoded Android resources of the application and its
// Dalvik bytecode translated into Java bytecode among other things.

// General Plugin Configuration
dexpatcherConfig {
    // This should point to a local clone of the DexPatcher Gradle plugin support tool
    // repo that is available here: https://github.com/Lanchon/DexPatcher-gradle-tools
    // But instead of defining the directory here, add a 'dexpatcher.dir' entry to the
    // 'local.properties' of the root project. That way it becomes available to all
    // subprojects and the local configuration is not posted to the VCS.
    //dir = '~/android/dexpatcher/dexpatcher-gradle-tools'

    // Specific Plugin Configuration
    apkLibrary {
        // Enable this setting to make this project ignore the clean task so that the built
        // apk library survives a global clean. You can always use the cleanApkLibrary or
        // cleanAll tasks to clean the library.
        disableClean = true
    }
}


// Configure the decodeApk, dex2jar and apkLibrary tasks here.
//decodeApk.keepBrokenResources = true
//dex2jar.translateCode = false
